## Issue Set Health

- [x] Core phase issue set created and tracked on GitHub
- [x] Phase 2 through Phase 6 implementation issues completed in repository state
- [x] Tracker references aligned to release naming (`sport`, `kbr`)
- [x] Planning links retained for audit trail

---

## Current Tracking Notes

- Phase 2-6 issue content remains relevant as implementation history.
- Ongoing work now belongs to release hardening and post-release phases.
- New work should be filed under post-release milestones, not historical Phase 2 setup tasks.

---

## Operational Checklist

- [x] Keep issue labels consistent by phase and priority
- [x] Keep docs/planning trackers synced with implementation status
- [ ] Open post-release milestone issues (Phase 7+)
- [ ] Assign remaining release-ops tasks (tag/changelog/deployment checklist)
