# ViccoBoard - Unified Teacher Suite

ViccoBoard is a comprehensive teacher application that combines **SportZens** (physical education organization and assessment) and **KURT** (exam creation, correction, and grading) into a single, unified platform.

## 🎯 Project Vision

A single application that provides the full functionality of:
- **SportZens**: Class organization, grading, live classroom tools, WOW workouts, and statistics
- **KURT**: Exam structuring, correction, feedback, support tips, long-term tracking, and email distribution

## Implementation Status Note

The feature lists below describe the full target scope. Current implementation progress is tracked in `STATUS.md` and `ISSUES_TRACKER.md`.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

```
ViccoBoard/
├── packages/          # Core packages
│   ├── core/         # Domain models, interfaces, storage abstractions
│   └── plugins/      # Plugin registry and contracts
├── modules/          # Domain modules
│   ├── sport/        # SportZens functionality
│   ├── exams/        # KURT functionality
│   ├── export/       # PDF/CSV/Email exports
│   └── integrations/ # WebUntis, grade apps, sharing
└── apps/             # Applications
    ├── teacher/      # Main teacher app (mobile)
    └── wow-web/      # WOW web interface for students
```

### Core Principles

1. **No Features Left Behind**: Every feature from both SportZens and KURT is included
2. **Modular Architecture**: New domains can be added as modules/plugins without core changes
3. **Local-First/Offline, iPadOS Safari-first**: Runs as static web app; data stays local; network only when explicitly needed (WOW link/QR, email). No Electron/Node server at runtime.
4. **Security & Backups**: Encrypted local storage, app lock (PIN/password), backup/restore with visible backup status/reminders (Safari may purge local storage after inactivity)

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Mobile Framework**: React Native / Flutter (TBD based on environment)
- **Storage**: Encrypted IndexedDB (browser-first, Safari/WebKit compatible) — SQLite adapter available for Node/dev and testing (SQLCipher ready); exports/imports via download/file-picker (no File System Access API)
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture + Domain-Driven Design
- **Plugin System**: Interface-based extensibility

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- npm 10.x or higher

### Quick Demo

See ViccoBoard in action with a working demonstration:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\build-and-run.ps1

# Unix/Mac/Linux
chmod +x build-and-run.sh
./build-and-run.sh

# Or manually
npm run build
npm run demo
```

### Build Scripts

```bash
# Build everything (packages + apps)
npm run build

# Build only internal packages (core/modules/plugins/storage)
npm run build:packages

# Build the iPad app only (teacher UI)
npm run build:ipad
```

### Run The App

```bash
# Teacher UI (iPad target) - dev server
cd apps/teacher-ui
npm run dev

# Teacher UI - production preview
npm run build
npm run preview

# Demo CLI app (optional)
cd apps/demo
npm run dev
```

The demo creates a class, enrolls students, records attendance, and shows statistics - proving the entire architecture works end-to-end!

See [DEMO_COMPLETE.md](./DEMO_COMPLETE.md) for details.

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies for a specific package
cd packages/core && npm install

# Build a specific package
cd packages/core && npm run build

# Run tests (when available)
npm test
```

### Contributing

This project follows strict modularity principles:
1. Core knows only interfaces, never implementations
2. Each module is self-contained
3. Plugins extend functionality without core changes
4. All features from Plan.md must be implemented
